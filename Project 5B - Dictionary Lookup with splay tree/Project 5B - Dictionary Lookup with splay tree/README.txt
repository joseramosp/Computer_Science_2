* Project 5B - Dictionary Lookup with splay tree
---------------------------

* This project has as its purpose to make a tree that can reflect the most recent search or the most searched domain in a tree.
In this project you will combine a map (key-value record) with the splaytree to create a fast lookup of domain names.

The requirements of this project are:

1- Define a key-value record class. The key must be comparable.
2- Modify the play tree (in the example area) to store records.
3- Write a main class that creates a map-splay tree
4- Generate a list of 25 domain names and their corresponding IP address (they can be real or made up)
5- Create records for each of the domain-IP pairs. The domain is the key and the IP is the value
6- Insert all records into the map-tree
7- Print the tree in a way you can identify the levels (or at least the root)
8- Use your list to randomly select domain names to look up.
9- print the tree (as before) after each look up.

* The main of this project is in the "Main.java" file compile and run that file to see the output of the program.

* Sadly I could'n finish this project because all the others class that had to work on.

* Citations: None.
