* Project 5A - 20Q with BSTree
---------------------------

* This project has as its purpose to make a game called 20 Questions but using A BSTree. The game has the ability of learning new answers and add a new question that can lead to that answer.

The requirements of this project are:

1- Use a linked Binary Tree (from the book or implement your own) to model the program as discussed above.
2- Build the tree using file input.
3- Save the tree using file output
4- Load the tree from file at program start.
5- Save the tree each time it is changed

* The main of this project is in the "Main.java" file compile and run that file to see the output of the program.

* In this project, the most difficult part was to create the file from the file that contains all the questions and answers (the QuestionAndAnswersOfTheTree).

* Citations: None.

NOTE: Please make sure that the QuestionAndAnswersOfTheTree.txt is inside of the src folder to make it available for the program.
